 * 2.12

### Operating systems

## Continuous integration

## Troubleshooting & Known issues

* No identified logs files.
* Analyzed files and previews are stored in `/var/_pandora/pandora/tasks/`.
* Extensions considered as malicious by default are defined in pandora/workers/blocklists.py. This is independent of clean return by hashlookup. (example: dropzone.min.js)

* pandora not starting after install, automatically or manually
```
_pandora@test:~/pandora$ /usr/local/share/poetry/bin/poetry run update --yes
* Update repository.

* pandora shutting down itself just after start
Possibly related to systemd hardening or some missing components.

* `[Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/runner/.config/pypoetry/config.toml` at pandora install.
This happens in GitHub action and only on Ubuntu 22.04
It has not been reproducible locally.

* poetry 1.2.1 seems to introduce a regression with dulwich module

https://github.com/jelmer/dulwich/issues/1032
Normally fixed in upstream dulwich 0.20.46 but still seeing occurrence. As workaround, either revert to poetry 1.1.15, either force use of system git.
